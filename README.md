# Stellar Game Studio

Build two-player Soroban games with a testnet dev sandbox and a production-ready wallet flow.

Docs: https://jamesbachini.github.io/Stellar-Game-Studio/
Repo: https://github.com/jamesbachini/Stellar-Game-Studio

## Quick Start (Dev)

```bash
# Fork the repo, then:
git clone https://github.com/<your-handle>/Stellar-Game-Studio
cd Stellar-Game-Studio
bun install

# Build + deploy contracts to testnet, generate bindings, write .env
bun run setup

# Scaffold a game + dev frontend
bun run create my-game

# Run the standalone dev frontend with testnet wallet switching
bun run dev:game my-game
```

## Publish (Production)

```bash
# Export a production container and build it (uses CreitTech wallet kit v2)
bun run publish my-game --build

# Update runtime config in the output
# dist/my-game-frontend/public/game-studio-config.js
```

## Project Structure

## Commands

```bash
bun run setup                         # Build + deploy testnet contracts, generate bindings
bun run build [contract-name...]      # Build all or selected contracts
bun run deploy [contract-name...]     # Deploy all or selected contracts to testnet
bun run bindings [contract-name...]   # Generate bindings for all or selected contracts
bun run create my-game                # Scaffold contract + standalone frontend
bun run dev:game my-game              # Run a standalone frontend with dev wallet switching
bun run publish my-game --build        # Export + build production frontend
```

## Requirements

- All games must call `start_game` and `end_game` on the Game Hub contract.
- Game Hub enforces exactly two players per session.
- Keep randomness deterministic between simulation and submission.
- Prefer temporary storage with a 30-day TTL for game state.

## Notes

- Dev wallets are generated during `bun run setup` and stored in the root `.env`.
- Production builds read runtime config from `public/game-studio-config.js`.

## Studio Reference

Run the studio frontend locally (from `sgs_frontend/`):
```bash
bun run dev
```

Build docs into `docs/`:
```bash
bun --cwd=sgs_frontend run build:docs
```
